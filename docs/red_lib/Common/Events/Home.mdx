### What is "Events"?

Events is a package of this library that allows you to use FiveM events in a smoother way and to save time writing resource names in event strings.
Also it allows to rename your resource not worrying on internal events not being renamed.

It does **NOT** overwrite natives, so if you like them as they are you're free to use them.
