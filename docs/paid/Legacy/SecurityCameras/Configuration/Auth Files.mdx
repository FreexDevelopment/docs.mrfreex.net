Auth files represent the biggest challenge while configuring the script.
If your environment matches the script defaults (uses a supported version of ESX or QB) then you probably don't need to edit these files.
However, if you are having issues like notifications not showing up, nil variable error spamming and any weird error, you probably do need to edit them.

:::info
Auth files are meant to be an API that interacts with the script and supplies its independent core with the information it needs
to behave correctly.
:::

:::note
Auth files are located in the `/modules/public/` folder.
:::

## Client Side

### InitFramework

```lua title="(string) -> object"
local initFramework = function(version)
    ...
    return core
end
```

The job of this function is to return the Framework core.
If your framework is different from QB or ESX you should change the content of this function to return
the core object of your framework.

### pDataLoop

```lua title="() -> any"
local pDataLoop = function()
    ...
end
```

This function is used to update the player data object when necessary.

### GetAuth

```lua title="() -> string"
local GetAuth = function()
    if PlayerData == nil or PlayerData.job == nil or PlayerData.job.name == nil then return end
    return PlayerData.job.name -- In this case, for default reasons, it returns the job name
end
```

*GetAuth* must return a string that matches the management parameter of the interested zones config,
the script uses this function to determine wheter a player has access to a specific zone.
In the above case (default code) we can see that it depends on the pDataLoop described before.

### notify

```lua title="(string) -> any"
local notify = function(text)
    local f = (FxCfg.options.useFramework == "ESX") and ESX.ShowNotification or QBCore.Functions.Notify
    return f(text)
end
```

This function does exactly what its name tells, it sends a notification with the given text.

:::caution
If you're using ESX double check that your version is new enough to support the used notification syntax
:::

:::note
Make sure to edit this function if you are using a custom notification system
:::

### isAbleToRepair

```lua title="(boolean) -> boolean"
local isAbleToRepair = function(standard) -- Must return true in order for the player to be able to fix the cameras // The parameter is the standard auth ( player has a management role for the zone )
    return standard
end
```

This function is used to differentiate the view and delete permissions from the repair permissions.
The parameter "standard" allows you to know wheter the player would be authorized to view them.

:::note
This function is meant to be used in RP servers to create a separate job that can repair cameras
:::

### drawInfo

```lua title="(string, vector3) -> any"
local drawInfo = function(text,coords) -- Used for drawing text in 3d, change to your liking
    AddTextEntry('HelpText', text)
    SetFloatingHelpTextWorldPosition(1, coords)
    SetFloatingHelpTextStyle(1, 1, 2, -1, 3, 0)
    BeginTextCommandDisplayHelp('HelpText')
    EndTextCommandDisplayHelp(2, false, false, -1)
end
```

As the comment suggests, this function handles the drawing of the blips for repairing or viewing the cameras.
The default system uses the *HelpText* blip, a clean and built-in 3d marker.


### hideUi

```lua title="(boolean) -> any"
local hideUi = function(show) 
    ExecuteCommand("toggleui")
end
```

This function is useful to hide other UIs when the cameras UI is active.
The default code invokes the *toggleui* command, used in the *trew_hud_ui* resource.

:::caution
The `show` parameter is inverted. It is false when the UI should be visible, and false otherwise.
:::

### onCamBroken

```lua title="(object, object, boolean) -> any"
local onCamBroken = function(baseCfg,cameraCfg,hasAuth) -- hasAuth is true when the player has the permissions needed to view the camera
    if hasAuth then
        ...
    end
end
```

This function is an event handler triggered when a camera gets broken.
It gets triggered on all clients and the function body decides wheter to show it to everyone or just the authorized
players.

Here's a description of the parameters: 

- `baseCfg` : the config object for the zone the broken camera is in;
- `cameraCfg` : the config object for the broken camera;
- `hasAuth` : wheter the player would be authorized to view the camera (true) or not (false);

## Server Side

### Exposed Variables

:::info
Exposed variables are variables that are not local to the core scope and can be read by the auth_sv.lua script.
:::

These particular variables are used to trigger core functions whenever needed.

**E.G.** : When the initFramework function registers the items, it calls the functions inside the `ItemCbs` object to trigger the wanted behaviour.

```lua title="ItemCbs"
{
    "cameraItem" = function() ... end,
    "itemtoView" = function() ... end
}
```

This is currently the only exposed variable.

- `cameraItem` : triggers the placement of a camera it takes the player id as first argument;
- `itemtoView` : shows the tablet UI on a player.

### initFramework

(Same as client-side)

```lua title="(string) -> object"
local initFramework = function(version)
    ...
    return core
end
```

The job of this function is to return the Framework core.
If your framework is different from QB or ESX you should change the content of this function to return
the core object of your framework.

### removeItem

```lua title="(string, number, number) -> any"
local removeItem = function(item, q, source)
    if FxCfg.options.useFramework == "ESX" then
        local xp = ESX.GetPlayerFromId(source)
        xp.removeInventoryItem(FxCfg.options.cameraItem, 1)
    elseif FxCfg.options.useFramework == "QB" then
        local p = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(source)
        p.Functions.RemoveItem(FxCfg.options.cameraItem, 1, "")
    end
end
```
This function removes an item from the player inventory (usually the security camera item).

Parameters :

- `item` : The item name;
- `q` : The quantity to remove;
- `source` : The target's serverID.


### notify


```lua title="(string, number) -> any"
local notify = function(text,pid)
    TriggerClientEvent('esx:showNotification', pid, text)
end
```
This function sends a notification to a player.

Parameters : 

- `text` : The notification body;
- `pid` : The target's serverID.
