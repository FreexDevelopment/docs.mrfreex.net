import SampleConfig from '@site/static/img/docs/cameras/sample-config.png'; 

The config file, named `config.lua` contains the most basic configuration options.

## Zones configuration

```lua
    ...
    cameras = {
        pacific = {
            label = "Pacific Standard",
            managementOverride = "Law Enforcement Agencies",
            management = { 
                {
                    label = "Police",
                    job = "police"
                }
            },

            cams = {},

            repairCams = vector3(263.1777, 211.5018, 110.2872)
        }
    }
    ...
```

The shown code illustrates an example of a working configuration.

The configuration parameters mean the following:

- **label** : The shown name of the zone on the tablet and the placement configurator.
- **managementOverride** : When set, the tablet management section shows its value (by default, a string with the management jobs separated by comas is shown).
- **management** : The authorized jobs for the zone. Each job must have a *label* and a *job* parameter, where the job is the framework job id.
- **cams** : A set of pre-existing cameras can be shown from the beginning. Each camera is an object with a *label*, a *coords* (as a vector3) and a *heading* parameter. We suggest using in-game placement as this was a really old feature.
- **repairCams** : Describes the position of the 3d marker that is used to trigger the cam repairing.

To create a zone, simply copy and paste the default displayed zone ("pacific") and add a coma after the existing one.
Then change the name of the zone to avoid duplicates and edit it accordingly to your needs.

Example of a multi-zone config:

```lua
...
    cameras = {
        pacific = {
            label = "Pacific Standard",
            managementOverride = "Law Enforcement Agencies",
            management = { 
                {
                    label = "Police",
                    job = "police"
                }
            },

            cams = {},

            repairCams = vector3(263.1777, 211.5018, 110.2872)
        },

        // highlight-next-line
        zone2 = {
            label = "Another zone",
            managementOverride = "Another job",
            management = { 
                {
                    label = "Medics",
                    job = "ambulance"
                }
            },

            cams = {},
            // highlight-next-line
            repairCams = vector3(112.6789, 111.1058, 100.0562)
        },

    }
...
```

The highlighted lines must be different between zones in order for the script to work properly

## Generic Options
```lua
...
    options = {
        useFramework = "ESX", -- available: ESX,QB
        esxEvent = "esx:getSharedObject",
        debug = true,
        drawDistance = 5.0,
        drawSleep = 50, -- Higher : more optimized, blips lag; Lower : less optimized, blips are fluid
        timeToFixCams = 60 * 1000 * 10, -- Ms that take for cameras to be fixed
        itemtoView = "tablet", -- Item name (ESX/QB only) that if used opens the cameras menu
        cameraItem = "security_camera", -- Camera item (ESX/QB only) that can be placed via an in game menu,
        mountControls = {
            up = 172, -- you can find all of the controls here : https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/controls/
            down = 173,
            left = 174,
            right = 175,
            rleft = 20,
            rright = 26
        },
        ui = {
            menuLogo = "https://www.rapidalarms.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dome-cctv-camera.jpg",
            menuText = "Los Santos CCTV"
        }
    }
...
```

Many settings in the *options* object are pretty much self-explanatory or explained by comments.


### The mount controls

:::caution
Deprecated, the script now uses the UI to move the camera.
