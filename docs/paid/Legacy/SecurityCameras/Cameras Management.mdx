## How-To
Security Cameras can be viewed by whoever possesses the tablet Item or from watching posts.<br/>
When you interact with the item or with the viewing blip you will be prompted by a menu that shows all the zones you have authorization for.

:::caution

If you are not authorized to view any zone, the menu will not open, prompting a notification instead.

  <summary>Physical access points</summary>

    <div>Access Points show in the form of markers</div>
    <br />
    <img src={AccessPoints} />

The <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faWifi} /> button, connects to the camera.

## Information about cameras

A camera status is described by the circle showing over the camera icon.


When the circle is:

- **<WithColor color="#AF1414">Red</WithColor>**, the camera has been broken and cannot be viewed (see "Repairing the cameras")
- **<WithColor color="#FFB224">Yellow</WithColor>**, the camera is being repaired - it should display as repaired after a few minutes
- **<WithColor color="#00AF49">Green</WithColor>**, the camera is working

### Graph

The graph resumes the cameras status by showing how many are working, broken or being repaired.
