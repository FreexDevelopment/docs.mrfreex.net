### What is it?

Red Dispatch is the first product of the Red series.
The script includes a patrols and calls management system for law enforcement agencies in your server.

### Features

- Officer stats: rank, RP name and a customizable registration code
- Shift management: Create custom shift sections or add notes to automatically generated ones
- Patrol management: Set your patrol status between "On Service" <ComponentIcon component={UserPolice}  /> "Busy" <ComponentIcon component={BanSolid} /> and "Not available" <ComponentIcon component={MugHotSolid} />
- Panic Button system: Activated by pressing a button on the "Patrol" tab or via item
- Calls and Patrols management: Allows management of all active patrols and calls to configured people. These officers can create, edit and close calls, assign patrols to calls and view all the patrols with their active officers.
